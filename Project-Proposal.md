# Web Scraping & Linear Regression  Proposal



## Question/need:

**What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?**

Recently, many people are turnout toward buying a used car over a new car in order to save money.  with the increased global demand in used car sales, many companies have launched online marketplaces which serve as a mediator for selling and buying cars.

The prices of new cars in the industry is fixed by the manufacturer with some additional costs incurred by the Government in the form of taxes. but for used cars, it can be stressful for sellers to value their car because the price depends on many factors.  It is important to know the actual market value while both buying and selling. There is a need for a used car price prediction system to effectively determine the worthiness of the car using a variety of features.

Our goal in this project is to predict used cars' market value by applying machine learning skills. We intend to use web scraping tools which are BeautifulSoup and Selenium for acquiring data from different websites. after acquiring the data, we are going to apply feature engineering and data cleaning algorithms using Pandas. 

 subsequently, we are planning to build a linear regression model and evaluate that model to help clients in predicting used car's price



**Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?**

* Used car sellers (dealers)

* Individuals

* Online pricing services





## Data Description:

**What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?**

In this project, We intend to scrape two website and use additional dataset for more comprehensive used car data.


* [Cars.com](https://www.cars.com/): Website for shopping and selling used cars. there is a list of features for each car.

*[Craigslist Cars-trucks Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data) : a dataset from Craigslist. it contains all relevant information on used car sales including price, condition, manufacturer, and other 23 columns. the dataset is scraped every few months has over 426k rows.
