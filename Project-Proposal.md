# Web Scraping & Linear Regression  Proposal



## Question/need:

**What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?**

Recently, many people are turnout toward buying a used car over a new car in order to save money.  With the increased global demand in used car sales, many companies have launched online marketplaces which serve as a mediator for selling and buying cars.

The prices of new cars in the industry is fixed by the manufacturer with some additional costs incurred by the Government in the form of taxes. But for used cars, it can be stressful for sellers to value their car because the price depends on many factors.  It is important to know the actual market value while both buying and selling. There is a need for a used car price prediction system to effectively determine the worthiness of the car using a variety of features.

Our goal in this project is to predict used cars' market value by applying machine learning skills.



**Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?**

* Used car sellers (dealers).

* Individuals.

* Online pricing services.





## Data Description:

**What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?**

In this project, we intend to scrape two website and use additional dataset for more comprehensive used car data.


* [Cars.com](https://www.cars.com/): Website for shopping and selling used cars. There is a list of features for each car.

* [Cargurus.com](https://www.cargurus.com/) : Website for buying and selling new and used cars.

* [Craigslist Cars-trucks Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data) : a dataset from Craigslist. It contains all relevant information on used car sales including price, condition, manufacturer, and other 23 columns.




## Tools:
**How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project?**

The following libraries will be used in order to successfully complete the project.
* Numpy and pandas to perfom data manipulations.
* Matplotlib to plot visulalizations.
* BeautifulSoup and Selenium to perform web scraping. 
* Scikit-learn to perform regression.
* Streamlit tool to build a simple web page.
